## Introduction

In this case study I will write about ChatGPT. ChatGPT, which stands for chat generative pre-trained transformer, is a chatbot made by OpenAI and publically launched on November 30, 2022.

ChatGPT, stems from the robust GPT-3 model, it is specialized in variant finely tuned for engaging and dynamic conversational interactions. The journey began with the pre-training of GPT-3 on a vast and diverse dataset, enabling it to grasp intricate language patterns. Subsequently, through a meticulous fine-tuning process, ChatGPT emerged, tailored to excel in generating contextually relevant and coherent responses in conversation. The model's development involved iterative feedback loops, with users actively contributing insights during the research preview phase. As a result, ChatGPT has become a cutting-edge tool, showcasing the fusion of advanced neural network architecture and real-world user input. Its introduction has not only marked a significant stride in language generation but also opened new possibilities for applications across various domains.

## Brief History

This ChatGPT timeline history will focus on the history of OpenAI labs and the history of ChatGPT spesifically. There is additional history on the developments of AI and natural language processes that is not covered here that stems back to the mid ninteen hundreds. 

- 2015: OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research lab, was founded.

- June 16, 2016: OpenAI publishes research on generative models.

- June 2018: OpenAI releases the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model.

- February 2019: OpenAI releases GPT-2, a larger and more powerful version of GPT.

- June 2020: OpenAI releases GPT-3, a massive language model with 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models at the time.

- November 2020: The initial prototype launch year. OpenAI releases ChatGPT, a chatbot based on GPT-3.5.

- February 2021: Launch of ChatGPT Plus 

- November 30, 2022: OpenAI introduces ChatGPT, that uses GPT-3.5 language technology. It comprehends numerous languages and can generate contextually relevant responses. However, its proficiency depends on the data it is trained on, indicating its finite capabilities.

- February 2023: ChatGBT became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's valuation to $29 billion.

- March 2023: OpenAI launched the ChatGPT API, allowing developers to incorporate ChatGPT functionality into their applications. Early adopters: SnapChatâ€™s My AI, Quizlet Q-Chat, Instacart, and Shop by Shopify.

- March 2023: OpenAI releases GPT-4, designed for producing safer and more useful responses. The same month, The Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling all AI labs to pause training of powerful AI systems for six months, citing risks to society and humanity.

- September 2023: OpenAI reveals DALL-E 3, an advanced version of its image generator, which is integrated into ChatGPT. This allows ChatGPT users to generate images through the chatbot.
